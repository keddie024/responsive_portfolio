        <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p id="p1"><img src="assets/images/profile_picture.jpg" alt="Picture of me" id="profileImage">My name is Kevin Eddie and I am currently enrolled in the UCF Coding Boot Camp. My goal is to one day become a web developer with a reputable company. My experience with coding began in high school where I worked with HTML and CSS during my senior year. Along with that, I had also taken an introductory course for Visual Basic and C#. Though my current knowledge is limited, I intend to persevere until I am fluent in the most common programming languages. I know this will be a tough journey and I am confident in my ability to succeed.<br><br> The path I took to get here is similar to many of my classmates. As a teenager, my first job was bussing tables for a local BBQ restaurant. Through hard work I was able to climb my way up to cashier, then to shift manager, and finally to the assistant manager position. After demonstrating my abilities to organize and lead the team I was given the reins as the general manager. Years were spent with that company until opportunities opened elsewhere further south where I worked in transportation as a professional chauffeur and reservation specialist. The outbreak of Covid-19 heavily impacted business and I realized it was time to start a new chapter in my life. This brings me to where I am now; eager and ready to absorb as much information as possible so that I can apply it to my next career!</p>
